# Game-of-life

This is first Hive-independent project.

The idea behind this project is to create something moderately interesting and try to dvelve into some stuff that could be forbidden by the Norm, like rand(). The basic stuff defined by norm is still respected, like 25 line limit per function, as they are just good coding practices.
Minilibx is included too as I try to practice more using it, creating the output as proper visual presentation with tools I already know relatively well.

The "original" version I made was made with Java abou 1-2 years ago as excersise for a University course and so the idea behind this small project is to bring those ideas implemented in Java to C.
